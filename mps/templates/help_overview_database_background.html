        The Microphysiology Systems Database
        (<span class="glst">MPS-Db</span>)
        combines the loading, storage, and sharing of experimentally derived assay data and data curated from
        <span class="glst">reference data sources</span>
        with visualization and analysis tools to provide a powerful platform for designing experimental studies and performing computational modeling. The
        <span class="glst">MPS-Db</span>
        can store curated assay data and associated metadata from a wide variety of plate-based and microfluidic models. Data from
        <span class="glst">reference data sources</span>
        are brought into the
        <span class="glst">MPS-Db</span>
        to facilitate ease of access to those data and to support integration of data across curated data sources.
        <br><br>
        Data collected as part of experimental studies are manually curated into the
        <span class="glst">MPS-Db</span>.
        Data from reference data sources are manually and/or auto-curated. The
        <span class="glst">MPS-Db</span>
        provides tools to analyze and/or visualize data pulled from
        <span class="glst">reference data sources</span>,
        and also provides tools to analyze curated study data in combination with reference data. Data and features available in the
        <span class="glst">MPS-Db</span>
        are described briefly below.
        <br><br>
        Many of the terms used in the
        <span class="glst">MPS-GUI</span>
        and here in the
        <b>Help</b> page
        are defined in the glossary. It is recommended that users rely heavily on the glossary to assist in understanding how to appropriately review, edit, and/or add data to the
        <span class="glst">MPS-Db</span>.
